Playing style
MS Dhoni was a right-handed batsman and also played the role of a wicket-keeper. He mostly played shots in the back foot, that is, shifting his body weight on the right leg. He has his own famous cricket shot, called the "Helicopter", that can pick balls and send them in the galleries for six.[7]
